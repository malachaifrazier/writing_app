This application is called WriteTrack and is a writing project management software that aims to help writers maximize their productivity and reach their writing goals. 

### What it is not.

Write Track is not a program to do your writing in. It will track the time you spend on your project and other metrics that are relevant to the writing project that you are doing.

Write Track is a work in progress. If you have tips, suggestions or would like to get on the beta test list please contact me.
